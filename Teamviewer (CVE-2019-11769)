Author of Advisory: Tobias Gyoerfi, Thinking Objects GmbH

========================================================================

Overview:

Teamviewer 14.2.2558 allows local attackers under the same user context
as the running application to intercept user-provided administrative
account credentials during its update process.
These credentials can be consequently reused for privilege escalation.

========================================================================

Vulnerability Details:

Updating Teamviewer as a non-administrative user requires entering
administrative credentials into the application's GUI. 
Subsequently, these credentials are processed in Teamviewer.exe which
allows any application running in the same non-administrative user
context to intercept them in plain text. By using this technique,
a local attacker is able to obtain administrative credentials in order
to elevate privileges.

========================================================================

Proof of Concept (PoC):

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting code into
Teamviewer.exe which intercepts calls to the affected window and logs
the processed credentials.

========================================================================

Solution:

Upgrade Teamviewer to version 14.4.2669.
